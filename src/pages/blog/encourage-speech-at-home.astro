        You don't need flashcards, apps, or special equipment to support your toddler's speech development. The best opportunities happen during everyday moments you're already having—meals, bath time, walks around the neighborhood.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-warmgray-600 mb-8 animate-on-scroll">
        Here are some simple, practical ways to encourage your child's communication skills at home.
      </p>

      </div>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mt-10 mb-4 animate-on-scroll">1. Narrate Your Day</h2>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        Talk through what you're doing, even if it feels silly. "I'm putting on your shoes. First the left foot, now the right foot. Let's tie them up!" This constant stream of language gives your child exposure to words, sentence structure, and how language connects to actions.
      </p>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        You don't need to quiz them or wait for responses. Just talk. They're absorbing more than you think.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mt-10 mb-4 animate-on-scroll">2. Get on Their Level</h2>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        Physically get down so you're face-to-face. Kneel, sit on the floor, lie on your belly—whatever puts you at eye level. This helps your child see your mouth forming words and makes communication feel more like a conversation than instructions from above.
      </p>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        It also signals that you're fully present, which makes them more likely to engage.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mt-10 mb-4 animate-on-scroll">3. Follow Their Lead</h2>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        If your toddler is interested in trucks, talk about trucks. If they're stacking blocks, narrate the block stacking. Children learn language best when it's connected to something they already care about.
      </p>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        Resist the urge to redirect to something "more educational." Their current obsession <em>is</em> the curriculum.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mt-10 mb-4 animate-on-scroll">4. Expand What They Say</h2>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        When your child says "dog," you say "Yes! Big brown dog." When they say "more," you say "You want more crackers?" This technique—called expansion—models richer language without correcting them or making them repeat after you.
      </p>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        You're showing them the next step, not testing them on it.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mt-10 mb-4 animate-on-scroll">5. Read Together (the Interactive Way)</h2>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        You don't have to read every word on the page. Point at pictures. Ask "Where's the cat?" Let them turn pages, even if it's out of order. Make animal sounds. Pause and let them fill in familiar words.
      </p>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        The goal isn't finishing the book—it's having a conversation around it.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mt-10 mb-4 animate-on-scroll">6. Embrace the Pause</h2>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        When your child is trying to communicate, give them time. It's tempting to jump in and finish their sentence or guess what they want. But waiting—even just a few extra seconds—gives them space to find the words.
      </p>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        Silence can feel awkward. That's okay. Let it sit.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mt-10 mb-4 animate-on-scroll">7. Sing Songs and Nursery Rhymes</h2>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        Music and rhythm make language stick. Songs like "Wheels on the Bus" or "Old MacDonald" are repetitive by design—that repetition helps children learn patterns and anticipate what comes next.
      </p>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        Don't worry about your singing voice. They're not critics.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mt-10 mb-4 animate-on-scroll">8. Limit Screen Time (Yes, Really)</h2>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        Screens aren't evil, but they're not a substitute for human interaction. Children learn language from people, not videos. The back-and-forth of real conversation—taking turns, reading facial expressions, adjusting based on responses—can't be replicated by an app.
      </p>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        If screens are part of your routine, try watching together and talking about what you see.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mt-10 mb-4 animate-on-scroll">9. Create Opportunities for Requests</h2>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        Instead of anticipating every need, create small moments where your child has to communicate. Put a favorite toy in sight but out of reach. Offer a closed container they need help opening. Give them a choice: "Apple or banana?"
      </p>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        These little moments build the habit of using language to get needs met.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mt-10 mb-4 animate-on-scroll">10. Don't Correct—Model</h2>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        If your child says "goggy" instead of "doggy," resist the urge to say "No, it's <em>doggy</em>." Instead, just use the correct word naturally: "Yes, that's a doggy! The doggy is running."
      </p>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        They'll get there. Correction can make kids self-conscious; modeling keeps communication positive.
      </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mb-4">The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-4">
          You're already doing more than you realize. Every conversation, every story, every silly song is building your child's language foundation. The best thing you can do is keep talking, keep listening, and keep showing up.
        </p>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600">
          If you're doing these things and still have concerns about your child's progress, that's okay too. Sometimes a little extra support makes a big difference.
