        Every child develops at their own pace—but as a parent, it's hard not to compare. If you've caught yourself wondering whether your toddler's speech is "normal," you're not alone. Here are five signs that a speech evaluation might be worth exploring.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mt-10 mb-4 animate-on-scroll">1. Limited Words for Their Age</h2>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        By 18 months, most toddlers say around 20 words. By age 2, that number jumps to 50 or more, with two-word combinations like "more milk" or "daddy go." If your child has significantly fewer words than these benchmarks—or isn't combining words by age 2—it may be worth a closer look.
      </p>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        That said, word count isn't everything. Some late talkers catch up on their own. The key is looking at the full picture.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mt-10 mb-4 animate-on-scroll">2. Difficulty Being Understood</h2>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        By age 2, unfamiliar listeners should understand about 50% of what your child says. By age 3, that jumps to around 75%. If grandparents, babysitters, or other adults consistently can't understand your toddler—even when you can translate—speech clarity might be an area to address.
      </p>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        Common patterns include dropping sounds from words ("ba" for "ball"), substituting sounds ("wabbit" for "rabbit"), or simplifying words in ways that make them hard to decode.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mt-10 mb-4 animate-on-scroll">3. Frustration When Communicating</h2>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        Toddlers get frustrated—that's normal. But if your child regularly melts down because they can't express what they want, or if they've stopped trying to communicate altogether, that's a signal. Some kids compensate by pointing, pulling you toward what they want, or acting out physically.
      </p>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        Communication should feel mostly successful for your child, even if it's not perfect. If it feels like a constant struggle, support can help.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mt-10 mb-4 animate-on-scroll">4. Not Responding to Their Name or Simple Directions</h2>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        By 12 months, most babies respond to their name consistently. By 18-24 months, toddlers typically follow simple directions like "get your shoes" or "give me the cup." If your child seems to tune out language—even when hearing is fine—it could indicate a receptive language delay.
      </p>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        Sometimes what looks like "not listening" is actually difficulty processing language. A speech evaluation can help sort out what's going on.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mt-10 mb-4 animate-on-scroll">5. Regression or Plateau in Skills</h2>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        If your child was saying words and then stopped, or if progress has stalled for several months, that's worth noting. Some regression around age 2 can be normal (especially during big developmental leaps), but significant or prolonged loss of words should be discussed with a professional.
      </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mb-4">What Should You Do?</h2>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-4">
          If any of these signs resonate, trust your gut. You know your child best. An evaluation doesn't mean something is "wrong"—it means you're gathering information to support your child in the best way possible.
        </p>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-4">
          Early intervention makes a real difference. The brain is incredibly adaptable in the toddler years, and kids who get support early often make faster progress.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mt-10 mb-4 animate-on-scroll">The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        Some toddlers are late talkers who catch up just fine. Others benefit from a little extra support. The tricky part is that it's hard to tell which is which without professional input. If you're wondering, it's always okay to ask.
      </p>
      <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-6 animate-on-scroll">
        The worst case? You get reassurance that everything is on track. The best case? You catch something early and give your child a head start.
