  {
    question: "What's the difference between a speech delay and a language delay?",
    answer: "Speech refers to how sounds are produced—the physical act of talking. Language is the system of communication itself: vocabulary, grammar, understanding, and expressing ideas. A child can have clear speech but struggle with language, or vice versa. Many children have both."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if my child has a language delay?",
    answer: "Signs include using fewer words than peers, difficulty putting words together, trouble following directions, limited understanding of questions, or relying heavily on gestures instead of words. If your child seems behind in how they understand or express language compared to other kids their age, an evaluation can provide clarity."
  },
  {
    question: "What causes language delays?",
    answer: "Language delays can have many causes, including hearing issues, developmental differences, limited language exposure, or sometimes no clear cause at all. The good news is that early intervention works regardless of the underlying reason. We focus on what we can do to help your child progress."
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly will I see progress?",
    answer: "Every child is different. Some make rapid gains in the first few weeks; others progress more gradually. What I can tell you is that children who receive early intervention and have families who practice strategies at home tend to make the fastest progress."

        Language is how we share ideas, ask questions, and connect with others. When a child struggles to understand or express language, it affects every part of their day. Early support can help them catch up and thrive.

        <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-4">
          Language delays affect how children understand what they hear (receptive language) and how they express themselves (expressive language). A child might have difficulty with one or both areas.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mb-4">How I Help Children with Language Delays</h2>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-4">
          Language therapy in your home means we can work with real situations: the breakfast table, the toy bin, the backyard. This context helps your child connect words to their actual life, not abstract flashcards.
        </p>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-4">
          I use play-based, naturalistic strategies that follow your child's interests. If they love cars, we build language around cars. If they're obsessed with bubbles, bubbles become our teaching tool. Children learn language fastest when it's tied to things they care about.
        </p>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600">
          I also coach you on strategies to use throughout the day—at mealtimes, during bath, while running errands. The more language-rich moments your child experiences, the faster they'll progress. You're their most important teacher.
