  {
    question: "At what age should my child be able to say all sounds correctly?",
    answer: "Most children master all speech sounds by age 7-8. However, certain sounds develop earlier than others. For example, sounds like 'p,' 'b,' and 'm' typically emerge by age 2-3, while 'r,' 's,' and 'th' are often mastered later. If your child's speech is difficult to understand for their age, an evaluation can determine if therapy would help."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I tell if my child has an articulation problem?",
    answer: "Signs include consistently substituting one sound for another (like 'wabbit' for 'rabbit'), leaving sounds off words ('ca' for 'cat'), or being difficult to understand compared to peers. By age 3, strangers should understand about 75% of your child's speech. If not, it may be worth an evaluation."
  },
  {
    question: "Will my child outgrow their speech sound errors?",
    answer: "Some speech sound errors are developmentally appropriate and resolve naturally. Others persist without intervention. A speech-language pathologist can determine whether your child's errors are expected for their age or if therapy would help them progress faster."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does articulation therapy usually take?",
    answer: "The duration varies based on the number and type of sounds being targeted, the child's age, and how consistently practice happens at home. Some children make significant progress in a few months; others may need longer. I'll give you a clearer picture after the initial evaluation."

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mb-4">What Are Articulation Disorders?</h2>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-4">
          Articulation refers to how we physically make speech sounds using our lips, tongue, teeth, and palate. When a child has an articulation disorder, they have difficulty producing certain sounds correctly, even though they know the words they want to say.
        </p>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600">
          This can look like substituting sounds ("wabbit" for "rabbit"), leaving sounds out ("nana" for "banana"), or distorting sounds (a "slushy" s sound). While some sound errors are normal in young children, persistent errors can make speech hard to understand and may affect confidence.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mb-4">How I Help Children Speak Clearly</h2>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-4">
          Articulation therapy starts with understanding exactly which sounds your child struggles with and why. During the evaluation, I assess how they produce different sounds and identify patterns that might be affecting their clarity.
        </p>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-4">
          In therapy, we work on sounds in a progression: first in isolation, then in syllables, words, sentences, and finally in conversation. I use games, activities, and your child's interests to make practice feel like play—because engaged kids make faster progress.
        </p>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600">
          Home practice is essential for articulation therapy. I'll show you simple activities and cues to use between sessions so your child gets the repetition they need. The good news is that a few minutes of daily practice can make a big difference.
