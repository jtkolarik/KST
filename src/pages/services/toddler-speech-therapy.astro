  {
    question: "Is my 2-year-old too young for speech therapy?",
    answer: "Absolutely not. In fact, ages 2-3 are an ideal time for speech therapy because the brain is incredibly adaptable during this period. Early intervention often leads to faster progress and better long-term outcomes. The earlier we start, the more we can leverage this critical window of development."
  },
  {
    question: "What does speech therapy look like for a toddler?",
    answer: "Toddler speech therapy looks like play. We use toys, books, songs, and everyday activities to create opportunities for communication. Sessions are child-led and happen in your home using your child's own things. I also coach you on strategies to use throughout your day."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you keep a toddler engaged during therapy?",
    answer: "By following their lead. If your toddler is interested in balls, we work on language through ball play. If they love snacks, snack time becomes a language opportunity. Children learn best when they're engaged and having fun, so therapy feels like play—not work."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if my toddler's speech is just 'delayed' or something more?",
    answer: "That's exactly what an evaluation helps determine. I look at the full picture: how many words they have, how they communicate without words, how they understand language, and how they're developing overall. From there, I can tell you whether watching and waiting makes sense or whether therapy would help."

        The toddler years are a critical window for language development. If your 2- or 3-year-old isn't talking as much as you'd expect, early intervention can make a meaningful difference—and it doesn't have to feel like "therapy."

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mb-4">Why Early Intervention Matters</h2>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-4">
          Between ages 2-3, the brain is uniquely primed for language learning. Neural pathways are forming rapidly, and children absorb language at an incredible rate. When we provide support during this window, children often make faster progress than they would if we waited.
        </p>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600">
          Research consistently shows that children who receive early intervention for speech and language concerns have better outcomes—not just in communication, but in reading, social skills, and academic success later on.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mb-4">What Toddler Speech Therapy Looks Like</h2>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-4">
          Therapy for toddlers doesn't look like sitting at a table with flashcards. It looks like playing on the floor with blocks, reading books, blowing bubbles, and having fun. We follow your child's interests and weave language into activities they already enjoy.
        </p>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-4">
          Sessions happen in your home, which is where toddlers are most comfortable. Your child's own toys, routines, and environment become our therapy materials. This helps skills generalize naturally to everyday life.
        </p>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600">
          I work with you just as much as I work with your child. You'll learn strategies you can use during meals, playtime, bath time, and everyday moments. The more practice your toddler gets throughout the day, the faster they'll progress.
