const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How many words should my toddler be saying?",
    answer: "By 18 months, most toddlers say around 20 words. By age 2, that number typically jumps to 50+ words with two-word combinations like 'more milk' or 'daddy go.' However, every child develops differently, and the quality of communication matters as much as quantity."
  },
  {
    question: "Will my late talker catch up on their own?",
    answer: "Some late talkers do catch up without intervention, especially if they understand language well and communicate through gestures. However, about half benefit from early support. An evaluation can help determine which path is right for your child."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I be concerned about my child's speech?",
    answer: "Consider an evaluation if your child has fewer than 20 words by 18 months, isn't combining words by age 2, seems to understand very little of what you say, or has lost words they used to say. Trust your instincts—if something feels off, it's worth exploring."
  },
  {
    question: "What does speech therapy for late talkers look like?",
    answer: "For toddlers, therapy is play-based and happens in your home using familiar toys and routines. I work with you and your child together, teaching strategies you can use throughout the day to encourage language development naturally."

        Your toddler is communicating in their own way—but you're wondering if their speech is on track. If your child has fewer words than expected for their age, you're not alone. Early support can make a meaningful difference.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mb-4">What Is a Late Talker?</h2>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-4">
          A late talker is typically a toddler between 18-30 months who has fewer words than expected but is otherwise developing normally. They might understand what you say, make eye contact, and communicate through pointing and gestures—they just don't have many spoken words yet.
        </p>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600">
          About 10-15% of two-year-olds are considered late talkers. While some catch up on their own, others benefit significantly from early intervention. The challenge is knowing which path your child is on—and that's where an evaluation helps.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mb-4">How I Help Late Talkers</h2>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-4">
          My approach is rooted in where your child is most comfortable—your home. Using your child's favorite toys, books, and daily routines, I create natural opportunities for language to emerge. This isn't about drilling flashcards; it's about making communication feel rewarding.
        </p>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-4">
          I also work closely with you as a parent. You're with your child far more than I am, so I teach you strategies to encourage speech throughout your day—during meals, bath time, play, and everyday moments. This parent-coaching approach leads to faster, more lasting progress.
        </p>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600">
          Every session is play-based and child-led. We follow your toddler's interests because children learn language best when they're engaged and having fun.
