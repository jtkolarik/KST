    question: "How is speech therapy different for children with autism?",
    answer: "Speech therapy for children with autism often focuses on functional communication—helping your child express needs, wants, and ideas in ways that work for them. This might include spoken words, gestures, pictures, or AAC devices. We also work on social communication skills like joint attention, turn-taking, and understanding nonverbal cues."
  },
  {
    question: "Does my child need an autism diagnosis before starting therapy?",
    answer: "No. If you have concerns about your child's communication or social development, an evaluation can help regardless of whether you have a formal diagnosis. Many families begin speech therapy while still pursuing or waiting for a diagnostic evaluation."
  },
  {
    question: "What communication approaches do you use?",
    answer: "I believe in meeting each child where they are. Depending on your child's needs, we might use naturalistic strategies during play, visual supports, augmentative communication tools, or techniques from approaches like PECS or the Hanen program. The goal is always functional, meaningful communication."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle sensory sensitivities during sessions?",
    answer: "Sessions happen in your home, which already helps reduce sensory overwhelm compared to a clinic. I follow your child's lead and adjust activities based on what they can tolerate. If certain textures, sounds, or activities are challenging, we work around them while still making progress."

        <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-4">
          Children with autism often experience communication differently. Some may have limited spoken language, while others speak fluently but struggle with the social aspects of conversation. Many fall somewhere in between.

        <p class="text-warmgray-600">
          What's important is finding the right approach for your child—one that builds on their strengths, respects their needs, and opens doors to meaningful connection with the people in their life.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-warmgray-700 mb-4">My Approach with Autistic Children</h2>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-4">
          I have special experience working with children on the autism spectrum. I believe in meeting your child exactly where they are—following their interests, respecting their sensory needs, and building communication in ways that feel natural to them.
        </p>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600 mb-4">
          Therapy happens in your home, which offers a huge advantage for kids who find new environments overwhelming. We work with your child's own toys, spaces, and routines, making it easier for skills to generalize to daily life.
        </p>
        <p class="text-warmgray-600">
          I also collaborate closely with you and any other providers involved in your child's care—ABA therapists, occupational therapists, teachers—to ensure everyone is working toward the same goals with consistent strategies.
